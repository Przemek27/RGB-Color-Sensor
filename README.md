# RGB-Color-Sensor
Basic color sensor

In the project I used the optical sensor APDS-9960 and development platform FRDM KL46Z enabled by the Kinetis L series KL4x MCU family built on the ARM Cortex-M0+ processor.
The board communicates with the sensor using the I2C interface. Data read from the sensor is sent to PC via UART.

Programming language: C
Software: Keil uVision5
